1.0
Read before playing
    
If you go into this mod thinking it will just be tab and do what you normally do it probably wont work out well. This mod is not meant to make the game harder or easier just to rebalance and make all units more viable which results in some units being buffed and others being nerfed.

Goal of the mod
    
Decrease random deaths from mutants
Rebalance meta of the game right. All runs are just build snipers then build titans. Doesn’t seem very fun would like to push for new army formations where it makes sense to have a combination of units
Fix some bad design decisions
 
Friendly Unit Changes
    
Rangers
      ○  Armor Penetration
       Purpose - Increase viability vs harder enemies without buffing them substantially early game
Soldiers
  ○ 33% Noise reduction
  ○ 33% Damage Reduction
  ○ 33% Attack Speed Increase
  Purpose - Increase viability earlier in the game, making them more competitive with snipers
Snipers
  ○ 10% Fire rate reduction
  ○ 10% Noise increase
  ○ Increase gold upkeep(Not intentional will be reverting this in v1.5)
  Purpose - Snipers are meta, want to get away from this. But still want them useful for clearing special infected still
Lucifer
  ○ 30% Noise reduction
  ○ 20% Run speed increase
  ○ No friendly fire
  Purpose - Lucifer can now be used as tank in the front lines of army
Titan
  ○ 10% damage reduction
  ○ 10% speed reduction
  ○ 10% health reduction
  Purpose - Titans are too good.
Thanatos
  ○ Unchanged

Enemy Unit Changes
    
Mutants
      ○ 60% sound reduction
      ○ 50% health increase
      ○ Spawn further from center of map
      ○ Noise generation when attacking reduced by 75%
      Purpose - No one likes pulling mutants but don't want decrease difficulty
Giants
    ○ 50% health increase
    ○ Spawn further from center of map
    Purpose - Campaign Giants feel like actual threats hoping this adjustment give the same feeling in survival

Chubbies
  ○ 25% health increase
  Purpose - More Chub

Harpy
  ○ None
  Purpose - Seem well balanced leaving as is. (was thinking of increasing damage to make them more deadly to your army making you want tank in front?)
Spitter
  ○ 25% Health increase
  Purpose - Feel like they are little weak at the moment

Game Changes
    
All maps are rolled at 900% (this means population density of the infected is like 900% as well as number of mutant and giants on all maps) I think some of the other maps are visually stunning and deserve being played more but are not considered by most since they do not have the same difficulty. With these changes they might now be actually harder considering they amount of gold the maps generate will not be adjusted
Future Changes
    
Adding both Hero's to be able to built. Don't quite know how they will fit in the meta leaving out for now and will implement them off feedback from this version.
Removing trash mayors for more consistent runs. Possibly adding in new mayors for more diverse runs.
Might make some difficulty modifiers for the first two maps? Could be a cool challenge mode?
